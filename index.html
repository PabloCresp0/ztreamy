            Ztreamy 0.2.1 has been released on 2014-12-01
            (<a href="download/">download</a>).
            This version depends on a specific version
            of the tweepy library, because their latest
            version seems to be unistalable.
            There aren't any other changes
            with respect to version 0.2.

          <p>
            Ztreamy 0.2 has been released on 2014-09-18
            (<a href="download/">download</a>). This version includes
            some fixes and facilitates the development of JavaScript
            clients by streaming events with JSON-LD syntax when the
            client requests that media type in the Accept HTTP header
            and by using CORS for facilitating cross-site JavaScript
            requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some fixes to the protocol (nicer media types for Ztreamy
            events and streams, mandatory CRLF line delimiters,
            compression signaled with the standard Content-Encoding
            HTTP header) make it incompatible with the previous
            versions of Ztreamy.  Once these changes have been
            introduced, the protocol is planned to be stable for the
            next versions.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
           Ztreamy is a prototype implementation of a framework for
           publishing streams of semantically-annotated data
           (e.g. readings from sensores) through on the Web, built on
           top of the <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado Web
           server</a>. The framework provides services that are
           specific to events described with RDF, although any other
           kinds of events can be transported as well.  The platform
           provides scalability through replication: streams can be
           repeated from other servers. Streams can also be aggregated
           and filtered.
